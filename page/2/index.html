	  <p>If you recall, in the last post we discussed disappointment panda and how it would be a crucial asset to us if we could…</p>
<h1 id="Be-our-own-disappointment-panda"><a href="#Be-our-own-disappointment-panda" class="headerlink" title="Be our own disappointment panda"></a>Be our own disappointment panda</h1><blockquote>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bamboo</li>
<li>Loads of space</li>
<li>An endangered species costume</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Jokes aside, its cruicial to cut the daily junk food diet of consumerism that attacks us. This is important for focus because it’s these that generally get us distracted from what we actually care about. Have you ever:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impulse bought items you didnt actually need from e-commerce sites?</li>
<li>Compulsively checked your phone when you should be working, studying or working out?<br>There are definitely actions within your reach which you can take. You most likely already know the steps you need to take to cure your bad habit. Then why don’t we all do it? </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="We-Lack-Motivation"><a href="#We-Lack-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="We Lack Motivation"></a>We Lack Motivation</h1><p>Its another wednesday afternoon. You’ve just come home from work and its 6pm in the evening. You look at your todo list and there in big bold letters it says “Start a video for a new Youtube channel.” Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I’m going to tell you how to defeat this lack of motivation today. But before that.</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was an aspiring author who, much like me, was interested in writing his own book. He set his vision and had the credentials he needed but could never get started on the right foot. He wrote paragraphs but they just didn’t look perfect. He could never seem to get it right unitil…</p>
<h1 id="Two-crappy-pages-per-day"><a href="#Two-crappy-pages-per-day" class="headerlink" title="Two crappy pages per day"></a>Two crappy pages per day</h1><p>That was the advice that allowed Tim Ferris to publish multiple bestsellers, including “The Four Hour Work Week.” </p>
<p>The reason why we think a lack of motivation occurs is because we normally do not get started until we get inspired and motivated to do so. However, motivation actually works like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3EE8Mia.png" alt="Motivation Chain"></p>
<p>Many of us (including me) often make the mistake of starting at the inspiration. Instead, action is the element that is always within reach and when that is your only measure of success then, well, even failure pushes us forward.</p>
<p>Hope you guys got a lot out of it. Stay Tuned for next week’s post on productivity tools and how to best use them!</p>

	  <p>Posts like this have, and will likely continue to be in very high demand. Why?</p>
<h1 id="The-Urge-to-Procrastinate"><a href="#The-Urge-to-Procrastinate" class="headerlink" title="The Urge to Procrastinate"></a>The Urge to Procrastinate</h1><p>It has become a common figure in our ever distrated modern world. Procrastination can take many forms, but before we get to that…</p>
<h1 id="Disappointment-Panda"><a href="#Disappointment-Panda" class="headerlink" title="Disappointment Panda"></a>Disappointment Panda</h1><p>In his bestsellers which I highly recommend for everyone reading my blog since it gives a basic philosophy of life, author Mark Manson invents a creature called “Disappointment Panda”. Now he argues that this creature could be the one that nobody wants but everybody needs. He would be like the grease stain on an otherwise clear glass window. He would break our day by uttering phrases that nobody likes hearing but we all need to pay attention to. <strong>He</strong> would be the cure for our constant pleasure driven, consumption controlled life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh its the doorbell! Disappointment Panda just arrived. “Life is essentially just a series of problems, Deep” he says. I ask him to elaborate. “I see you just bought a new car. Now that takes care of the embarassment you felt owning a beater, but it leaves you with high maintainence fees, a high interest loan to pay and financial stress in your family”. And with that, he puts his hat back on his head and goes trotting off into the sunset, never to be seen again, leaving me wondering where he came from in the first place. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="How-does-this-have-anything-to-do-with-procrastination"><a href="#How-does-this-have-anything-to-do-with-procrastination" class="headerlink" title="How does this have anything to do with procrastination?"></a>How does this have anything to do with procrastination?</h1><p>Ever had that feeling where you wait for the motivation to come from elsewhere to get started on a task. Yesterday was one such day for me. I did everything except what I planned to get done! The morning was spent reading stories online and the afternoon and evening was spent catching up with friends and family. I needed disappointment panda to let me know what needed doing. I needed him to remind me that uni was going to open soon. But he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Coming up tomorrow, we will discuss how to make your own disappointment panda. Until then:</p>
<p><a href="https://markmanson.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s</a> a link to Mark’s blog for you to browse at your leisure! I recommend starting with his <a href="https://markmanson.net/why-you-procrastinate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on procrastination</a>. </p>

	  <h1 id="Why-have-proper-values"><a href="#Why-have-proper-values" class="headerlink" title="Why have proper values?"></a>Why have proper values?</h1><p>Imagine you are a young backpacker and are given a list of 5 countries to choose to go to, with the pros and cons of each countries listed. You will feel excited that you have freedom to travel to any one of them and will pick the most desirable one. Now say you have 30 countries to pick from. Studies show that the more choices you have, the less satisfied you will be with the choice you make. You may feel like Thailand would have been a better choice that Switzerland since the weather would have been tropical, even though you prefer mountains. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Values are like a siv, only thoughts and goals which align with your values are able to fit through the filter, allowing you to gain much higher levels of satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="What-are-my-values"><a href="#What-are-my-values" class="headerlink" title="What are my values?"></a>What are my values?</h1><p>You will be the best judge of what your values are. Below are some examples of good and bad values. </p>
<h3 id="Good-Values-You-have-control-over"><a href="#Good-Values-You-have-control-over" class="headerlink" title="Good Values (You have control over):"></a>Good Values (You have control over):</h3><ul>
<li>Internal Peace</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Respecting others</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Spending time with your close friends and family</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Bad-Values-You-have-no-control-over"><a href="#Bad-Values-You-have-no-control-over" class="headerlink" title="Bad Values (You have no control over):"></a>Bad Values (You have no control over):</h3><ul>
<li>Never be alone</li>
<li>Always be happy</li>
<li>Be popular</li>
<li>Earn lots of money</li>
<li>Be with many partners</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Auto-suggestion"><a href="#Auto-suggestion" class="headerlink" title="Auto-suggestion"></a>Auto-suggestion</h1><p>This is a technique which has been crucial for me in my value setting journey. Below are the brief steps to using this everyday:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a goal or value which you would like to attain. Make sure you do it one at a time. </li>
<li>Use a board or sheet of paper to write this goal so you read it every time you wake up. </li>
<li>Every time you do the relevant activity, have the goal in the back of your mind so you practice it.</li>
<li>Repeat the goal to yourself 3 or 4 time at least every day</li>
</ol>
<p>By simply following this strategy for many years, regardless of the difficulty of the goal, you will find it attainable. </p>
<p>And thats it for today folks! Make sure to tune in next time for a regular update on my daily life. See you there!</p>

	  <p>It happens to the best of us. Be it your favourite food, movie, game, job or hobby, we all get bored at some point. Why?</p>
<h1 id="Let-Me-Tell-You-a-Story"><a href="#Let-Me-Tell-You-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="Let Me Tell You a Story"></a>Let Me Tell You a Story</h1><p>My parents are really hard working middle-class people. Day in day out they spend their time diligently climbing their ways up the corporate ladder, trying to get the biggest slice of the pie with the least amount of work. However, when doing this, they are exceptionally bored with their daily lives. They look for holidays and weekends as an escape from their otherwise dull workplaces.</p>
<h2 id="Why-It-Never-Works"><a href="#Why-It-Never-Works" class="headerlink" title="Why It Never Works"></a>Why It Never Works</h2><p>Ever watched a horse on a race track? It was fast wasn’t it?  Now let’s say you’re in the era where no cars existed. You’re a horse taxi service which takes riders from location A to B in the least amount of time possible, the smaller the time, the more happy riders, and the more money you can potentially earn. What will you try to do to boost your profits? Recruit the fastest horses you can possibly get of course! You might even try to genetically engineer horses to make them faster and stronger. </p>
<p>I hope you can see why this strategy never works. The corporate ladder is engineered for long days and sleepless nights. It is carved so that its deciples are unable to see the bigger picture. </p>
<h1 id="Tread-Your-Own-Path"><a href="#Tread-Your-Own-Path" class="headerlink" title="Tread Your Own Path"></a>Tread Your Own Path</h1><p>How I avoid monotonity in the workplace:</p>
<p>Your values are the most crucial tool to solving the riddle of life. The priority that you give to each value will, over the long term, determine where you end up. Having good values is like learning the steps for solving a rubics cube. Just like there’s an incredibly minute chance that someone who has just picked up a properly scrambled rubics cube for the first time in their life will be able to solve it, there is also very little chance that that someone with inconsistent or vague values will be able to navigate life. Values must be prioritised, and we must ensure we are true to our values using a tactic I will introdouce next time called auto suggestion, first published in Napoleon Hill’s book “Think and Grow Rich”. More about that tomorrow.</p>
<p>As Always…</p>

	  <h2 id="Make-It-Up"><a href="#Make-It-Up" class="headerlink" title="Make It Up"></a>Make It Up</h2><p>I was always interested in a variety of different cultures during my upbringing. It intrigued me that ideologies with conflicting beliefs could exist. Like how can there be two different ways of looking at the same truth. Anyway, during this time I learnt about one of the key lessons from the Buddha himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life itself is a form of suffering”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. If you take someone and give them access to absolutely all desires from birth, will they become happy and contented that they are living in a state better than countless other people? Never! They will be ungreatful, they would like to explore other less than perfect worlds.</p>
<p>So if the happiness is actually in the climb instead, simply asking for the right things and struggling for them, makes you happy.</p>
<h2 id="Okay-I-want-a-cushy-job-good-wife-travel-a-lot-and-…-HOLD-IT"><a href="#Okay-I-want-a-cushy-job-good-wife-travel-a-lot-and-…-HOLD-IT" class="headerlink" title="Okay I want a cushy job, good wife, travel a lot and … HOLD IT!"></a>Okay I want a cushy job, good wife, travel a lot and … HOLD IT!</h2><p>That answer is so general that there are countless people saying the same thing. Yet its mostly objective and self centric. We need to establish a few rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your purpose needs to be something that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Helps others.</li>
<li>You can never achieve.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That way, not only do you feel good because you are constantly providing value to the community, you also are on this constant trendmill to struggle to reach an unreachable goal. Hence UNLIMITED HAPPINESS.</p>
<h2 id="Except-Not-Really"><a href="#Except-Not-Really" class="headerlink" title="Except Not Really"></a>Except Not Really</h2><p>Have you ever had that feeling when you do something hard for a long time and it becomes mundane and monotonous, like high school algebra or your first job? That’s what is bound to happen here too. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s post to find out how to avoid monotonity in your daily endeavours. </p>
<p>Until then, continue working. Think of goals which match the criteria above. I wish you all the best!</p>

	  <p>Welcome to my personal blog! Here I post about my countless endeavours in programming, personal finance and lifelong learning. Since, this is my first post and this blog was made using <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a>, I reckon it’s the perfect time to do a Hexo Tutorial! But before that, why did I decide to start a blog? Lets do a quick AskDeeplyDiligent!</p>
<h3 id="Oh-Another-Blog-Why"><a href="#Oh-Another-Blog-Why" class="headerlink" title="Oh Another Blog! Why?"></a>Oh Another Blog!

<p>I always have two central philosophies at the center of all my activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attain knowledge from a variety of sources. This has taken me everywhere from the darkest corners of Youtube, to School, and more recently, University. The desire to learn and be curious about esoteric topics from finance to human relations drives my intuition. It also means that I accept many different viewpoints and base my philosophy by taking feedback from each. </li>
<li>Share this knowledge using all means possible, so that I can empower people of all ages to be able to do work they never could before. It is this aspect of leadership that drives me, since it is only by working together that we can multiply our knowledge and output, pushing the world forward</li>

I’ll endeavour to post on a daily basis (no guarantees 😉) about my usual activities and what I learnt from that day.

	  <p>At the beginning there was nothing. Life didn’t even exist. We were created through years of evolution, centuries of change, millenia of catastrophies and era’s of knowledge and turmoil. Yet one of the most mind boggling questions that we always ask is…</p>
<h2 id="Why-Do-I-Exist"><a href="#Why-Do-I-Exist" class="headerlink" title="Why Do I Exist?"></a>Why Do I Exist?</h2><p>Look i’ll be honest I have no clue. Noone has any clue. Even when youre in heaven. Even when you’re farting fairy dust in your fancy Ferrari and three story mansion. You’ll still have no clue what you’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Try"><a href="#Why-Try" class="headerlink" title="Why Try?"></a>Why Try?</h2><p>I’m glad you asked. You see, many people make up their own mind about this after reading that theres no magic point to life. They realise that the dream house, the cushy job, the fancy wife are not all they are made up to be. So they quit. These are the so called “mid life crisis” points of our lives. We don’t know what we worked so hard to build. We suffer from the “hedonic tredmill” of always jumping on the next supposed high. Get this, eat that, try this, experience that. Its like a never ending cycle of misery.</p>
<p>How can we get a purpose?</p>
<p>We will be answering this question, along with how to set proper goals in tommorrow’s post. Stay tuned!</p>

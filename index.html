	  <p>Catching up is my life. It is only because I keep track of all the tasks which need to be done, date them, and do them after they are overdue that I can keep up with the constant gush of tasks that come my way. </p>

You’ve had a day off and are ready to kick back into the rhythm of your daily routine. The problem is that all the tasks from yesterday are now overdue. We need a proven strategy, an algorithm, to tackle all of this. </p>
<h1 id="My-Algorithm"><a href="#My-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="My Algorithm"></a>My Algorithm</h1><p>My algorithm for tackling weekly work</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>When I Am getting Behind</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t do it again, you have a set number of days</li>
<li>remove the distraction</li>
<li>do a five minute mindfulness session</li>
<li>start again from where you left off, do not skip anything</li>

	  <p>This is a point that is often discussed so I wanted to bring it up too:</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Catch-Up"><a href="#How-To-Catch-Up" class="headerlink" title="How To Catch Up"></a>How To Catch Up</h1><p>We’ve all been there. 1 day behind. 1 week behind. Even a whole semester behind with the exam in two days. How do you catch up. Well it does depend on how far behind you really are. There is a different level of commitment and prioritisation that is required for each specific condition. Depending on the severity of the gap, we need to adjust this to fit. </p>
<p>Lets discuss this in the next post. </p>

	  <p>Through many years of experimentation I have finally gathered enough data points to answer the question that all diligent students end up asking at some point.</p>

If you’re anything like most people, you plan out your day intricately, only to not follow the plan you carefully designed. This happens because of two main reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You were not aware of the time it would take to complete a task and hence fell behind schedule</li>
<li>You were trying to make an approximate schedule in which the time for each task was too long and no breaks were assigned.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In tomorrows series, we will continue to explore how to make better Kaizen decisions when it comes to honing your schedule so you can be more productivity during the times that matter to you the most. </p>

	  <p>Trying a Kaizen strategy in my application strategy for vacation and internship positions has got me thinking, how else can I use it to enhance my life, so that I am more energized, connected and can achieve more every day. Even just this mindset, no matter how small, can create the environment that is required to insinuate change.</p>
<h1 id="The-importance-of-holding-yourself-accountable"><a href="#The-importance-of-holding-yourself-accountable" class="headerlink" title="The importance of holding yourself accountable"></a>The importance of holding yourself accountable</h1><p>During the beginning of this semester, I listed out the activities which I would have to complete each and every day with one key request. The request was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write down exactly why you skipped this activity this week, including stuff which you could have done better in the future to make sure this doesnt happen again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By doing this, I got my brain into the habit of thinking about time as a precious entity and utilising it to the best of my abilities. </p>
<p>Next, I will take a look at what else I have done to ensure activities are completed, including setting due dates and tailoring activities to fit my other scheduled classes and work commitments. </p>

	  <p>If you recall, a few weeks ago I discussed the benefits of incremental improvement, based on the belief that fear is much harder to overcome when making a monumental change, compared to a small, purposeful manipulation. We discussed how we can use this in our own lives, with an example about work and family issues. Today, and probably from here on out, I will be writing about my own life and discuss the implications of doing Kaizen to fuel my self-improvement drive.</p>
<h1 id="One-Small-Step"><a href="#One-Small-Step" class="headerlink" title="One Small Step"></a>One Small Step</h1><p>What one small step did I take today, that can, in turn, create monumental changes in my life?</p>
<p>Today was Thursday. It has always been one of my goals to have one day where I focus on applying for work, fixing up my resume and other projects, rather than studying for uni. Of course I still have classes, but today was the day that I planned to do that. Although a lot of today was not put to the best of use, here is what I have done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied for a position at the Big 4</li>
<li>Started to add metrics and quantitative data to my resume</li>
<li>Developed the front-end for the database system </li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that this step puts me in the correct direction because a purposeful activity such as setting a day aside for this work allows me to get serious about applying for future roles. It also means I start thinking about how to get better at it each week, leading to further inspiration and motivation. </p>
<p>For now though, the small step has not left me very stressed or confused, so I am completely happy with it.</p>
<p>More about this tomorrow.  </p>

	  <p>It’s now easy to see why texting become the new norm for communication between adolescents. It can also be seen why there is a lack of strong bonding. Non-verbal communication can carry so much information that it can many times replace what is being said. It is no wonder that speakers from different countries who speak the same language can still have trouble communicating, since they come from vastly different cultures.</p>
<p>Short post for today! Stay tuned tomorrow for an insight into my activities for the past few weeks!</p>

When I walk in, the first thing I do is scan the area with my eyes to ensure it is safe.<br>But, this isn’t the way that a normal person would walk into someone else’s place, be it a restaurant, hotel or apartment. They would go to the front desk, take a seat and then start looking around for people to talk to.<br>The police had a severely hard time identifying why they were so easy to identify. </p>
<p>In the next blogpost, we will explore why teenagers in particular seem to have embraced the texting phenomenon.</p>

	  <p>We all do it. Day or Night. School or Work. We are constantly staring at a screen. In this series, I want to explore the consequences of this widespread phenomenon. I would also like to know how to best communicate in a thumb tapping world. So, how long do you spend staring at your phone?</p>
<h1 id="The-Like-Switch"><a href="#The-Like-Switch" class="headerlink" title="The Like Switch"></a>The Like Switch</h1><p>In his book, The Like Switch, Jack Schawfer explores the concept of phones and human communication. In a lecture, he instructs students to communicate face to face about any topic that interests them. The students are unable to utter anything meaningful. It takes a lot of both verbal and non-verbal communication to establish a strong connection and they simply lacked the skills to do this. Then came the phones. The students were asked to text each other instead of talking. Out came the funny, weird and charismatic personality hidden behind a wall of face to face communication. Why does this happen? We will explore this question and more in the next blog post. </p>

	  <p>Hey everyone, having just returned from a vacation, guess how I felt going straight back to University?</p>
<p>Lethargic, Demotivated and Pessimistic. I really thought, for the past few days, that the last year has been the best year, and I can’t do any better this time around. Then I turned around and questioned myself.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Keep-Climbing"><a href="#Why-Keep-Climbing" class="headerlink" title="Why Keep Climbing?"></a>Why Keep Climbing?</h1><p>Although I have posted a lot about the “single steps” that you can take in your journey of a thousand miles, I realise that I have somewhat ignored the reasons for undertaking the journey in the first place. So, I am going to give you three reasons why pushing will be beneficial for you.</p>
<h2 id="You-Want-Happiness"><a href="#You-Want-Happiness" class="headerlink" title="You Want Happiness"></a>You Want Happiness</h2><p>It is only by pushing yourself to do better that you will become happier. This is the reason why many retired individuals seek new experiences. It is the years of struggle which will strike you as the most insightful and pleasant. Embrace this.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Contribution-to-the-World"><a href="#Your-Contribution-to-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Your Contribution to the World"></a>Your Contribution to the World</h2><p>When you feel like you’re making an impact, you will be really compelled to do more. But what about when you feel you are a burden on the world, getting educated and fear you will not be able to give back as much? Well it is in times like these when we should remind ourselves about the valuable contribution that we will make once we have the knowledge and skills to do so. Without skills we may be able to reach a hundred. But with these skills, the number is multiplied due to greater reputation and we are able to help a lot more. </p>
<h2 id="Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task"><a href="#Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task" class="headerlink" title="Just Get Started on a Small Task"></a>Just Get Started on a Small Task</h2><p>When I came back, I knew that to get back to my old flow state, it wouldn’t be enough to remind myself of why I must take the first step. I also needed a clear first step to take. Getting started on the first task gives you the first rung on the ladder with which you can see the rest of the landscape clearer. Every step you take, it becomes easier to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>So, are you stuck in a peak, wondering how to proceed like me? Send me a message!</p>

	  <p>When I was much younger and struggled to get my homework done on its due date, I would become terrified. We know that every single task is like a small mountain that we need to climb and that theres a drop at the end where the grass will be a lot greener. </p>
<h1 id="Conquering-Mount-Everest"><a href="#Conquering-Mount-Everest" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Mount Everest"></a>Conquering Mount Everest</h1><p>I’m sure you have a task with a high importance, a task that will make a crucial impact on your life, that is currently too big for you to do. Two possible issues are that you may have many different smaller tasks which are more urgent (have a closer due date) or you have no clue where to start the big task. This is your Mount Everest. Lets take you through conquering it</p>
<h2 id="Getting-to-the-bottom"><a href="#Getting-to-the-bottom" class="headerlink" title="Getting to the bottom"></a>Getting to the bottom</h2><p>Before we can start climbing we must push all other tasks aside, leaving just the mountain itself. This is through prioritisation. Grab a pencil and start batching all the smaller tasks, then complete them one after another with minimal time wasted. Any tasks that you can defer, do it!</p>
<h2 id="Starting-the-climb"><a href="#Starting-the-climb" class="headerlink" title="Starting the climb"></a>Starting the climb</h2><p>Whether you cant think of somewhere to begin, or cant muster the motivation to put pen to paper, I guarantee that if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a tiny part of the task (read the assignment, write the first paragraph etc)</li>
<li>Allocate a set time that you think will be enough for it</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find the task at least partially interesting and doable. That initial hump is the biggest. A rule in physics is that a system is much easier to keep going than it is to restart. I believe this principle applies nicely here as well. All the best!</p>
<p>Next post, we will discuss what to do at the summit to prepare yourself best for the next task</p>

	  <p>We all do it. Day or Night. School or Work. We are constantly staring at a screen. In this series, I want to explore the consequences of this widespread phenomenon. I would also like to know how to best communicate in a thumb tapping world. So, how long do you spend staring at your phone?</p>
<h1 id="The-Like-Switch"><a href="#The-Like-Switch" class="headerlink" title="The Like Switch"></a>The Like Switch</h1><p>In his book, The Like Switch, Jack Schawfer explores the concept of phones and human communication. In a lecture, he instructs students to communicate face to face about any topic that interests them. The students are unable to utter anything meaningful. It takes a lot of both verbal and non-verbal communication to establish a strong connection and they simply lacked the skills to do this. Then came the phones. The students were asked to text each other instead of talking. Out came the funny, weird and charismatic personality hidden behind a wall of face to face communication. Why does this happen? We will explore this question and more in the next blog post. </p>

	  <p>Hey everyone, having just returned from a vacation, guess how I felt going straight back to University?</p>
<p>Lethargic, Demotivated and Pessimistic. I really thought, for the past few days, that the last year has been the best year, and I can’t do any better this time around. Then I turned around and questioned myself.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Keep-Climbing"><a href="#Why-Keep-Climbing" class="headerlink" title="Why Keep Climbing?"></a>Why Keep Climbing?</h1><p>Although I have posted a lot about the “single steps” that you can take in your journey of a thousand miles, I realise that I have somewhat ignored the reasons for undertaking the journey in the first place. So, I am going to give you three reasons why pushing will be beneficial for you.</p>
<h2 id="You-Want-Happiness"><a href="#You-Want-Happiness" class="headerlink" title="You Want Happiness"></a>You Want Happiness</h2><p>It is only by pushing yourself to do better that you will become happier. This is the reason why many retired individuals seek new experiences. It is the years of struggle which will strike you as the most insightful and pleasant. Embrace this.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Contribution-to-the-World"><a href="#Your-Contribution-to-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Your Contribution to the World"></a>Your Contribution to the World</h2><p>When you feel like you’re making an impact, you will be really compelled to do more. But what about when you feel you are a burden on the world, getting educated and fear you will not be able to give back as much? Well it is in times like these when we should remind ourselves about the valuable contribution that we will make once we have the knowledge and skills to do so. Without skills we may be able to reach a hundred. But with these skills, the number is multiplied due to greater reputation and we are able to help a lot more. </p>
<h2 id="Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task"><a href="#Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task" class="headerlink" title="Just Get Started on a Small Task"></a>Just Get Started on a Small Task</h2><p>When I came back, I knew that to get back to my old flow state, it wouldn’t be enough to remind myself of why I must take the first step. I also needed a clear first step to take. Getting started on the first task gives you the first rung on the ladder with which you can see the rest of the landscape clearer. Every step you take, it becomes easier to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>So, are you stuck in a peak, wondering how to proceed like me? Send me a message!</p>

	  <p>When I was much younger and struggled to get my homework done on its due date, I would become terrified. We know that every single task is like a small mountain that we need to climb and that theres a drop at the end where the grass will be a lot greener. </p>
<h1 id="Conquering-Mount-Everest"><a href="#Conquering-Mount-Everest" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Mount Everest"></a>Conquering Mount Everest</h1><p>I’m sure you have a task with a high importance, a task that will make a crucial impact on your life, that is currently too big for you to do. Two possible issues are that you may have many different smaller tasks which are more urgent (have a closer due date) or you have no clue where to start the big task. This is your Mount Everest. Lets take you through conquering it</p>
<h2 id="Getting-to-the-bottom"><a href="#Getting-to-the-bottom" class="headerlink" title="Getting to the bottom"></a>Getting to the bottom</h2><p>Before we can start climbing we must push all other tasks aside, leaving just the mountain itself. This is through prioritisation. Grab a pencil and start batching all the smaller tasks, then complete them one after another with minimal time wasted. Any tasks that you can defer, do it!</p>
<h2 id="Starting-the-climb"><a href="#Starting-the-climb" class="headerlink" title="Starting the climb"></a>Starting the climb</h2><p>Whether you cant think of somewhere to begin, or cant muster the motivation to put pen to paper, I guarantee that if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a tiny part of the task (read the assignment, write the first paragraph etc)</li>
<li>Allocate a set time that you think will be enough for it</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find the task at least partially interesting and doable. That initial hump is the biggest. A rule in physics is that a system is much easier to keep going than it is to restart. I believe this principle applies nicely here as well. All the best!</p>
<p>Next post, we will discuss what to do at the summit to prepare yourself best for the next task</p>

	  <p>Here is a way to measure yourself against Performance Metrics: A simple timetable. </p>
<h1 id="Out-of-simple-things-big-things-grow"><a href="#Out-of-simple-things-big-things-grow" class="headerlink" title="Out of simple things, big things grow"></a>Out of simple things, big things grow</h1><p>I once had a lemon plant. It didn’t grow very much in the Australian winter. Eventually it’s leaves started falling off and it was barely surviving. </p>
<p>That summer, I was forced to do a little bit of research on plantation. I learnt how to care for lemon trees in Australia and how they can grow up with just a little care, effort, and most importantly…<strong>fertiliser</strong>!</p>
<p>This is why Kaizen is so important. Keeping a very simple timetable will allow you to measure yourself against something quantifiable. It was also very easy to make on paper, so it would be hard to skip something that quick. </p>
<h1 id="Why-it’s-important"><a href="#Why-it’s-important" class="headerlink" title="Why it’s important"></a>Why it’s important</h1><p>Imagine you’re like me, trying to grow a lemon tree. Unless you measured the effect of each thing you tried: watering it, using different types of fertiliser, how would you know which one is working and which is not. It’s crucial to have a metric, since without it, the whole endeavour can go awfully awry. </p>

	  <p>In the previous post I described a quick process that you can use to set yourself on a successful path. In this post, I would like to dive into why this works.</p>
<h1 id="Spaceship-Analogy"><a href="#Spaceship-Analogy" class="headerlink" title="Spaceship Analogy"></a>Spaceship Analogy</h1><p>Ever seen a spaceship launch? I know that the glamour and amazement of watching the controlled explosion of metric tonnes of fuel leaves me excited and bewildered. </p>
<p>Let me ask you this though: How much time do you reckon a spaceship bound for the mood spends on course? 90%? 80%? Nope nope. Throughout the whole process of taking off, going into orbit, passing the point where the moon’s gravity overtakes the earth and landing on the moon, the spaceship is on couse only <strong>10%</strong> of time time. That’s right!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iconspng.com/uploads/cartoon-moon-rocket-remix-2/cartoon-moon-rocket-remix-2.png" alt="Spaceship"></p>
<h1 id="The-Importance-of-Course-Correction"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Course-Correction" class="headerlink" title="The Importance of Course Correction"></a>The Importance of Course Correction</h1><p>Your life is quite like a spaceship. We must self correct along the way. But doing so requires something else really crucial, a way to measure our success against performance metrics.</p>

	  <p>So, we’ve learnt what an average life looks like so lets…</p>
<h1 id="Spice-it-uppp-🔥🔥🔥"><a href="#Spice-it-uppp-🔥🔥🔥" class="headerlink" title="Spice it uppp  🔥🔥🔥"></a>Spice it uppp  🔥🔥🔥</h1><p>I want you to start with a big change in your life. I’m going to call this an ‘innovation’. Its pretty simple really, pick one of these: waking up early, changing to a healthy diet, sticking to a study schedule or regular exercise.</p>
<p>I’m going to assume very few people do all these already. If you are one of them, I’m sure you already have your own goals to use. </p>
<p>Now, Kiazen dictates that we must make a small change. Big changes are scary. Small changes are the ones which compel us to climb the ladder one step at a time.  Some small changes that I would suggest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an alarm for a time to go to bed (try to make waking up early natural)</li>
<li>Add one vegetable a day</li>
<li>Every time you fail, ask yourself what went wrong</li>
<li>Try doing just 10 pushups at a certain time every day</li>
</ul>
<p>See how I didnt instantly suggest the Keto diet, or joining a gym. That comes later. The momentum before those moves, however, is essential. </p>

	  <p>Lately I have been getting incredibly into researching a unique and valuable priciple known as Kaizen. Over the next few blogposts, I wish to take you through what Kaizen is, and how to apply it in your own life.</p>
<h1 id="A-Brief-Intro-to-Most-People’s-life"><a href="#A-Brief-Intro-to-Most-People’s-life" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Intro to Most People’s life"></a>A Brief Intro to Most People’s life</h1><p>Alright here we are, average. We go through 12 years of schooling, learning the bare minimum to get by. We hate learning, but know that we have to do it to get into a field that we can tolerate for the next 40 years. We confuse education and schooling, thinking that they are one and the same. We go get a bachaelors degree in a non-STEM field, hoping that the degree will be enough for us to get into a job. We <strong>try</strong> to focus and study but end up drunk at our best mate’s sister’s 21st Birthday Party. We mostly enjoy college, taking a bit of time off during exam time to cram some last minute revision, resenting every bit of it. During exams, we struggle to die down our nerves and due to a lack of proper exam technique, get mediocre results. Getting into jobs seems very difficult and so we settle. We settle for small companies paying mediocre wages. And we settle for a lackluster life of fullfilling family, management and social expectations. </p>
<p>Now I completely understand everyone who has a medical and other circumstance and I am in no way suggesting everyone is like this. However, in my life experience, this is pretty much stock standard <em>Average</em>. Ill be looking into improvements that we could make on this in tomorrow’s post!</p>

	  <p>I’m sure you’ve learn about the techniques that I use to prioritise tasks, but, you’re probably more curious about the tools that I use to achieve productive feats. I’ll however, have to answer that question with another question…</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-currently-use"><a href="#What-do-you-currently-use" class="headerlink" title="What do you currently use?"></a>What do you currently use?</h1><p>Its more than likely that what you use currently has the basic functionality already baked in to do what I described in yesterday’s post. Yet, we are constantly looking for new tools because we think that the tool can be a method to innovate drastic change into our daily schedule. Remember, Kaizen warns us against doing such drastic changes and discusses focusing on short term incremental goals, which would be much more achievable. </p>
<h4 id="Enough-mate-I-just-want-to-do-exactly-what-you-do-…and-thats-the-problem"><a href="#Enough-mate-I-just-want-to-do-exactly-what-you-do-…and-thats-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="Enough mate, I just want to do exactly what you do!…and thats the problem."></a>Enough mate, I just want to do exactly what you do!…and thats the problem.</h4><p>It’s not enough to do exactly what I do to achieve astounding results, you must also embody the mindset and philosophy of an over-achiever.</p>
<p>However, since some people will still ask for it, here is a brief snapshot of my Systems</p>
<h3 id="Trello"><a href="#Trello" class="headerlink" title="Trello"></a>Trello</h3><p>Trello has so far been my best “to-do list” type tracker. I have organised my trello on a weekly basis where I put in what needs to be done for which subject. I use trello for both individual and group projects</p>
<h3 id="Google-Calendar"><a href="#Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="Google Calendar"></a>Google Calendar</h3><p>Calendars are useful only for what they got made for, Time Management! Measure how much time you spent on each task and never lose track of the future tasks. Please do not turn your calendar into a todo list, since there could be many other ways you could categorise tasks other than its due date!</p>
<h3 id="Google-Drive"><a href="#Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Google Drive"></a>Google Drive</h3><p>This is your go to all-in-one, unlimited free usb storage that you cant lose again! Trust me, so much hassle saved when trying to plug the usb into the presentation computer, only to turn out that it was in a different usb. </p>
<p>I hope that helped! Next up is a blog about travel, since this is what i’ve been up to lately :D</p>

	  <p>You might be thinking to yourself right now, all these concentration development tactics are great and all, but how do I actually put them into practice? As a student, this question has also been a focus of mine, so let me take a few moments to highlight my strategy (as suggested by Cal Newport) and the reason for each step. You will see lots of the strategies that Cal discusses, as well as some improvements that I have made.</p>
<h1 id="The-Student-Samurai"><a href="#The-Student-Samurai" class="headerlink" title="The Student Samurai"></a>The Student Samurai</h1><p>Soon, you too could be knocking tasks out like your favourite cartoon character. Let me show you exactly how:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to know what we need to do, and by when. Use your favourite to do list, be it digital or paper and pen, to do this.</li>
<li>We then need to condense this information into a calendar, so you can plan to do certain tasks in certain sections of the day</li>
<li>Finally, make sure trivial tasks such as taking the trash out, minor cleaning and planning meetups are clumped together and done in one part of the day. This way we can focus and get these done as fast as we can.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Reason"><a href="#Reason" class="headerlink" title="Reason"></a>Reason</h1><p>The reason that we create a huge todo list first is to give our brain the freedom to list out all its desires. Then, by prioritising this onto a calendar we are setting a clear goal for ourselves which we will strive to achieve. This is much better than, say, just checking things off as you do them. Finally, clumping minor tasks together allows Deep Work to take place, so that we can truely focus on the main tasks in the main parts of the day.  </p>
<h1 id="Pitfalls"><a href="#Pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Pitfalls"></a>Pitfalls</h1><p>Some major problems with this method are that predicting timing of each task can be a challenge. I normally address this with a technique called Kaizen, which definitely deserves its own blogpost. However, in short, Kaizen is the practice of repeatedly enforcing small positive changes based on the outcome from a previous decision, which in this case would be whether you went under or over time, and you would base future predictions on that task accordingly. There’s a lot more to Kaizen, and I really suggest reading “One Small Step Can Change Your Life” to find out more about this technique. </p>

	  <p>I realise that normally my blogs are quite general adressing key issues in our lives, but recently, I have realised a disconnect between the time management tools everybody uses, and the outcomes that we wish to achieve in our flexible lives where we are forced to adopt to circumstances which no-one could have guessed, on a daily basis.</p>
<h1 id="3-Quick-Ways-to-reclaim-your-time"><a href="#3-Quick-Ways-to-reclaim-your-time" class="headerlink" title="3 Quick Ways to reclaim your time"></a>3 Quick Ways to reclaim your time</h1><p>In his book “Deep Work”, Cal Newport discusses the importance of focus to achieve the task at hand. He discusses that companies, rather than embodying deep work principles, are now discouraging it with new open offices and Instant Messaging. He argues that the only way to achieve great insights is to put our distractions aside and concentrate for long stretches of time.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with his principles, we can all agree that a rejection of some alternatives here would lower our stress and increase productivity. Here are some of my techniques for doing just that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduce Stimulus: How many times in the last hour has your phone vibrated due to some notification? Turning my phone onto constant Do Not Disturb mode (not even vibrations) has significantly increased my focus. I no longer get distracted by IM notifications. Remember to whitelist apps such as your calendar which help you keep track of time. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Set a goal to work Monday to Friday 9 to 5: Recall that when we discussed motivation, we set up small actions and committed to doing just those? It’s tough, I get it. Been there done that. Something is always delayed and takes up the whole weekend. But this is just one of the “do something” actions that you can adopt that will create further inspiration for yourself. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Work ‘in a flow state’: Most people work ‘busy and anxious’. This is because they are constantly reacting to stimulus. When you are in a flow state, you will be indifferent to stimulus, since you will be constantly achieving your targets. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope these 3 quick time savers have been useful for you. Next, we will take a look at schedules for students and what I personally use. All the best!</p>

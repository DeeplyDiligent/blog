Here I post about my countless endeavours in programming, personal finance and lifelong learning. Since, this is my first post and this blog was made using Hexo, I reckon it‚Äôs the perfect time to do a Hexo Tutorial! But before that, why did I decide to start a blog? Lets do a quick AskDeeplyDiligent! Oh Another Blog! Why?1234while (human.exists())&#123; learn(); teach();&#125; I always have two central philosophies at the center of all my activities: Attain knowledge from a variety of sources. This has taken me everywhere from the darkest corners of Youtube, to School, and more recently, University. The desire to learn and be curious about esoteric topics from finance to human relations drives my intuition. It also means that I accept many different viewpoints and base my philosophy by taking feedback from each. Share this knowledge using all means possible, so that I can empower people of all ages to be able to do work they never could before. It is this aspect of leadership that drives me, since it is only by working together that we can multiply our knowledge and output, pushing the world forward Ah Cool!

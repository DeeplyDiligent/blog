We are constantly staring at a screen. In this series, I want to explore the consequences of this widespread phenomenon. I would also like to know how to best communicate in a thumb tapping world. So, how long do you spend staring at your phone? The Like SwitchIn his book, The Like Switch, Jack Schawfer explores the concept of phones and human communication. In a lecture, he instructs students to communicate face to face about any topic that interests them. The students are unable to utter anything meaningful. It takes a lot of both verbal and non-verbal communication to establish a strong connection and they simply lacked the skills to do this. Then came the phones. The students were asked to text each other instead of talking. Out came the funny, weird and charismatic personality hidden behind a wall of face to face communication. Why does this happen? We will explore this question and more in the next blog post."},{"title":"Fighting for Completion (Part 2)","permalink":"http://deeplydiligent.github.io/blog/2018/07/26/Fighting-for-Completion-Part-2/","text":"Hey everyone, having just returned from a vacation, guess how I felt going straight back to University? Lethargic, Demotivated and Pessimistic. I really thought, for the past few days, that the last year has been the best year, and I can‚Äôt do any better this time around. Then I turned around and questioned myself. Why Keep Climbing?Although I have posted a lot about the ‚Äúsingle steps‚Äù that you can take in your journey of a thousand miles, I realise that I have somewhat ignored the reasons for undertaking the journey in the first place. So, I am going to give you three reasons why pushing will be beneficial for you. You Want HappinessIt is only by pushing yourself to do better that you will become happier. This is the reason why many retired individuals seek new experiences. It is the years of struggle which will strike you as the most insightful and pleasant. Embrace this. Your Contribution to the WorldWhen you feel like you‚Äôre making an impact, you will be really compelled to do more. But what about when you feel you are a burden on the world, getting educated and fear you will not be able to give back as much? Well it is in times like these when we should remind ourselves about the valuable contribution that we will make once we have the knowledge and skills to do so. Without skills we may be able to reach a hundred. But with these skills, the number is multiplied due to greater reputation and we are able to help a lot more. Just Get Started on a Small TaskWhen I came back, I knew that to get back to my old flow state, it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to remind myself of why I must take the first step. I also needed a clear first step to take. Getting started on the first task gives you the first rung on the ladder with which you can see the rest of the landscape clearer. Every step you take, it becomes easier to see the bigger picture. So, are you stuck in a peak, wondering how to proceed like me? Send me a message!"},{"title":"Fighting for Completion","permalink":"http://deeplydiligent.github.io/blog/2018/07/25/Fighting-for-Completion/","text":"When I was much younger and struggled to get my homework done on its due date, I would become terrified. We know that every single task is like a small mountain that we need to climb and that theres a drop at the end where the grass will be a lot greener. Conquering Mount EverestI‚Äôm sure you have a task with a high importance, a task that will make a crucial impact on your life, that is currently too big for you to do. Two possible issues are that you may have many different smaller tasks which are more urgent (have a closer due date) or you have no clue where to start the big task. This is your Mount Everest. Lets take you through conquering it Getting to the bottomBefore we can start climbing we must push all other tasks aside, leaving just the mountain itself. This is through prioritisation. Grab a pencil and start batching all the smaller tasks, then complete them one after another with minimal time wasted. Any tasks that you can defer, do it! Starting the climbWhether you cant think of somewhere to begin, or cant muster the motivation to put pen to paper, I guarantee that if you: Think of a tiny part of the task (read the assignment, write the first paragraph etc) Allocate a set time that you think will be enough for it You will find the task at least partially interesting and doable. That initial hump is the biggest. A rule in physics is that a system is much easier to keep going than it is to restart. I believe this principle applies nicely here as well. All the best!

Out of simple things, big things growI once had a lemon plant. It didn‚Äôt grow very much in the Australian winter. Eventually it‚Äôs leaves started falling off and it was barely surviving. That summer, I was forced to do a little bit of research on plantation. I learnt how to care for lemon trees in Australia and how they can grow up with just a little care, effort, and most importantly‚Ä¶fertiliser! This is why Kaizen is so important. Keeping a very simple timetable will allow you to measure yourself against something quantifiable. It was also very easy to make on paper, so it would be hard to skip something that quick. Why it‚Äôs importantImagine you‚Äôre like me, trying to grow a lemon tree. Unless you measured the effect of each thing you tried: watering it, using different types of fertiliser, how would you know which one is working and which is not.

Big changes are scary. Small changes are the ones which compel us to climb the ladder one step at a time. Some small changes that I would suggest are: Make an alarm for a time to go to bed (try to make waking up early natural) Add one vegetable a day Every time you fail, ask yourself what went wrong Try doing just 10 pushups at a certain time every day See how I didnt instantly suggest the Keto diet, or joining a gym.

Over the next few blogposts, I wish to take you through what Kaizen is, and how to apply it in your own life. A Brief Intro to Most People‚Äôs lifeAlright here we are, average. We go through 12 years of schooling, learning the bare minimum to get by. We hate learning, but know that we have to do it to get into a field that we can tolerate for the next 40 years. We confuse education and schooling, thinking that they are one and the same. We go get a bachaelors degree in a non-STEM field, hoping that the degree will be enough for us to get into a job. We try to focus and study but end up drunk at our best mate‚Äôs sister‚Äôs 21st Birthday Party. We mostly enjoy college, taking a bit of time off during exam time to cram some last minute revision, resenting every bit of it. During exams, we struggle to die down our nerves and due to a lack of proper exam technique, get mediocre results. Getting into jobs seems very difficult and so we settle. We settle for small companies paying mediocre wages. And we settle for a lackluster life of fullfilling family, management and social expectations. Now I completely understand everyone who has a medical and other circumstance and I am in no way suggesting everyone is like this. However, in my life experience, this is pretty much stock standard Average.

I‚Äôll however, have to answer that question with another question‚Ä¶ What do you currently use?Its more than likely that what you use currently has the basic functionality already baked in to do what I described in yesterday‚Äôs post. Yet, we are constantly looking for new tools because we think that the tool can be a method to innovate drastic change into our daily schedule. Remember, Kaizen warns us against doing such drastic changes and discusses focusing on short term incremental goals, which would be much more achievable. Enough mate, I just want to do exactly what you do!‚Ä¶and thats the problem.It‚Äôs not enough to do exactly what I do to achieve astounding results, you must also embody the mindset and philosophy of an over-achiever. However, since some people will still ask for it, here is a brief snapshot of my Systems TrelloTrello has so far been my best ‚Äúto-do list‚Äù type tracker. I have organised my trello on a weekly basis where I put in what needs to be done for which subject. I use trello for both individual and group projects Google CalendarCalendars are useful only for what they got made for, Time Management!

As a student, this question has also been a focus of mine, so let me take a few moments to highlight my strategy (as suggested by Cal Newport) and the reason for each step. You will see lots of the strategies that Cal discusses, as well as some improvements that I have made. The Student SamuraiSoon, you too could be knocking tasks out like your favourite cartoon character. Let me show you exactly how: First, we need to know what we need to do, and by when. Use your favourite to do list, be it digital or paper and pen, to do this. We then need to condense this information into a calendar, so you can plan to do certain tasks in certain sections of the day Finally, make sure trivial tasks such as taking the trash out, minor cleaning and planning meetups are clumped together and done in one part of the day. This way we can focus and get these done as fast as we can. ReasonThe reason that we create a huge todo list first is to give our brain the freedom to list out all its desires. Then, by prioritising this onto a calendar we are setting a clear goal for ourselves which we will strive to achieve. This is much better than, say, just checking things off as you do them. Finally, clumping minor tasks together allows Deep Work to take place, so that we can truely focus on the main tasks in the main parts of the day. PitfallsSome major problems with this method are that predicting timing of each task can be a challenge. I normally address this with a technique called Kaizen, which definitely deserves its own blogpost. However, in short, Kaizen is the practice of repeatedly enforcing small positive changes based on the outcome from a previous decision, which in this case would be whether you went under or over time, and you would base future predictions on that task accordingly. There‚Äôs a lot more to Kaizen, and I really suggest reading ‚ÄúOne Small Step Can Change Your Life‚Äù to find out more about this technique."},{"title":"Using Digital Productivity Tools Effectively","permalink":"http://deeplydiligent.github.io/blog/2018/07/18/Productivity-Tools/","text":"I realise that normally my blogs are quite general adressing key issues in our lives, but recently, I have realised a disconnect between the time management tools everybody uses, and the outcomes that we wish to achieve in our flexible lives where we are forced to adopt to circumstances which no-one could have guessed, on a daily basis. 3 Quick Ways to reclaim your timeIn his book ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù, Cal Newport discusses the importance of focus to achieve the task at hand. He discusses that companies, rather than embodying deep work principles, are now discouraging it with new open offices and Instant Messaging. He argues that the only way to achieve great insights is to put our distractions aside and concentrate for long stretches of time. Whether or not you agree with his principles, we can all agree that a rejection of some alternatives here would lower our stress and increase productivity. Here are some of my techniques for doing just that: Reduce Stimulus: How many times in the last hour has your phone vibrated due to some notification? Turning my phone onto constant Do Not Disturb mode (not even vibrations) has significantly increased my focus. I no longer get distracted by IM notifications. Remember to whitelist apps such as your calendar which help you keep track of time. Set a goal to work Monday to Friday 9 to 5: Recall that when we discussed motivation, we set up small actions and committed to doing just those? It‚Äôs tough, I get it. Been there done that. Something is always delayed and takes up the whole weekend. But this is just one of the ‚Äúdo something‚Äù actions that you can adopt that will create further inspiration for yourself. Work ‚Äòin a flow state‚Äô: Most people work ‚Äòbusy and anxious‚Äô. This is because they are constantly reacting to stimulus. When you are in a flow state, you will be indifferent to stimulus, since you will be constantly achieving your targets. I hope these 3 quick time savers have been useful for you.

You will feel excited that you have freedom to travel to any one of them and will pick the most desirable one. Now say you have 30 countries to pick from. Studies show that the more choices you have, the less satisfied you will be with the choice you make. You may feel like Thailand would have been a better choice that Switzerland since the weather would have been tropical, even though you prefer mountains. Values are like a siv, only thoughts and goals which align with your values are able to fit through the filter, allowing you to gain much higher levels of satisfaction. What are my values?You will be the best judge of what your values are. Below are some examples of good and bad values. Good Values (You have control over): Internal Peace Honesty Respecting others Learning Spending time with your close friends and family Bad Values (You have no control over): Never be alone Always be happy Be popular Earn lots of money Be with many partners Auto-suggestionThis is a technique which has been crucial for me in my value setting journey. Below are the brief steps to using this everyday: Set a goal or value which you would like to attain. Make sure you do it one at a time. Use a board or sheet of paper to write this goal so you read it every time you wake up. Every time you do the relevant activity, have the goal in the back of your mind so you practice it.

Be it your favourite food, movie, game, job or hobby, we all get bored at some point. Why? Let Me Tell You a StoryMy parents are really hard working middle-class people. Day in day out they spend their time diligently climbing their ways up the corporate ladder, trying to get the biggest slice of the pie with the least amount of work. However, when doing this, they are exceptionally bored with their daily lives. They look for holidays and weekends as an escape from their otherwise dull workplaces. Why It Never WorksEver watched a horse on a race track? It was fast wasn‚Äôt it? Now let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in the era where no cars existed. You‚Äôre a horse taxi service which takes riders from location A to B in the least amount of time possible, the smaller the time, the more happy riders, and the more money you can potentially earn. What will you try to do to boost your profits? Recruit the fastest horses you can possibly get of course! You might even try to genetically engineer horses to make them faster and stronger. I hope you can see why this strategy never works. The corporate ladder is engineered for long days and sleepless nights. It is carved so that its deciples are unable to see the bigger picture. Tread Your Own PathHow I avoid monotonity in the workplace: Your values are the most crucial tool to solving the riddle of life. The priority that you give to each value will, over the long term, determine where you end up. Having good values is like learning the steps for solving a rubics cube. Just like there‚Äôs an incredibly minute chance that someone who has just picked up a properly scrambled rubics cube for the first time in their life will be able to solve it, there is also very little chance that that someone with inconsistent or vague values will be able to navigate life. Values must be prioritised, and we must ensure we are true to our values using a tactic I will introdouce next time called auto suggestion, first published in Napoleon Hill‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThink and Grow Rich‚Äù.

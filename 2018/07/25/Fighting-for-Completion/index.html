    	<p>When I was much younger and struggled to get my homework done on its due date, I would become terrified. We know that every single task is like a small mountain that we need to climb and that theres a drop at the end where the grass will be a lot greener. </p>
<h1 id="Conquering-Mount-Everest"><a href="#Conquering-Mount-Everest" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Mount Everest"></a>Conquering Mount Everest</h1><p>Iâ€™m sure you have a task with a high importance, a task that will make a crucial impact on your life, that is currently too big for you to do. Two possible issues are that you may have many different smaller tasks which are more urgent (have a closer due date) or you have no clue where to start the big task. This is your Mount Everest. Lets take you through conquering it</p>
<h2 id="Getting-to-the-bottom"><a href="#Getting-to-the-bottom" class="headerlink" title="Getting to the bottom"></a>Getting to the bottom</h2><p>Before we can start climbing we must push all other tasks aside, leaving just the mountain itself. This is through prioritisation. Grab a pencil and start batching all the smaller tasks, then complete them one after another with minimal time wasted. Any tasks that you can defer, do it!</p>
<h2 id="Starting-the-climb"><a href="#Starting-the-climb" class="headerlink" title="Starting the climb"></a>Starting the climb</h2><p>Whether you cant think of somewhere to begin, or cant muster the motivation to put pen to paper, I guarantee that if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a tiny part of the task (read the assignment, write the first paragraph etc)</li>
<li>Allocate a set time that you think will be enough for it</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find the task at least partially interesting and doable. That initial hump is the biggest. A rule in physics is that a system is much easier to keep going than it is to restart. I believe this principle applies nicely here as well. All the best!</p>
<p>Next post, we will discuss what to do at the summit to prepare yourself best for the next task</p>

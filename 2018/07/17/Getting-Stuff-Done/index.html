<h1 id="The-Urge-to-Procrastinate"><a href="#The-Urge-to-Procrastinate" class="headerlink" title="The Urge to Procrastinate"></a>The Urge to Procrastinate</h1><p>It has become a common figure in our ever distrated modern world. Procrastination can take many forms, but before we get to that…</p>
<h1 id="Disappointment-Panda"><a href="#Disappointment-Panda" class="headerlink" title="Disappointment Panda"></a>Disappointment Panda</h1><p>In his bestsellers which I highly recommend for everyone reading my blog since it gives a basic philosophy of life, author Mark Manson invents a creature called “Disappointment Panda”. Now he argues that this creature could be the one that nobody wants but everybody needs. He would be like the grease stain on an otherwise clear glass window. He would break our day by uttering phrases that nobody likes hearing but we all need to pay attention to. <strong>He</strong> would be the cure for our constant pleasure driven, consumption controlled life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh its the doorbell! Disappointment Panda just arrived. “Life is essentially just a series of problems, Deep” he says. I ask him to elaborate. “I see you just bought a new car. Now that takes care of the embarassment you felt owning a beater, but it leaves you with high maintainence fees, a high interest loan to pay and financial stress in your family”. And with that, he puts his hat back on his head and goes trotting off into the sunset, never to be seen again, leaving me wondering where he came from in the first place. </p>

Yesterday was one such day for me. I did everything except what I planned to get done! The morning was spent reading stories online and the afternoon and evening was spent catching up with friends and family. I needed disappointment panda to let me know what needed doing. I needed him to remind me that uni was going to open soon. But he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Coming up tomorrow, we will discuss how to make your own disappointment panda. Until then:</p>

    	<p>Hey everyone, having just returned from a vacation, guess how I felt going straight back to University?</p>
<p>Lethargic, Demotivated and Pessimistic. I really thought, for the past few days, that the last year has been the best year, and I can’t do any better this time around. Then I turned around and questioned myself.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Keep-Climbing"><a href="#Why-Keep-Climbing" class="headerlink" title="Why Keep Climbing?"></a>Why Keep Climbing?</h1><p>Although I have posted a lot about the “single steps” that you can take in your journey of a thousand miles, I realise that I have somewhat ignored the reasons for undertaking the journey in the first place. So, I am going to give you three reasons why pushing will be beneficial for you.</p>
<h2 id="You-Want-Happiness"><a href="#You-Want-Happiness" class="headerlink" title="You Want Happiness"></a>You Want Happiness</h2><p>It is only by pushing yourself to do better that you will become happier. This is the reason why many retired individuals seek new experiences. It is the years of struggle which will strike you as the most insightful and pleasant. Embrace this.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Contribution-to-the-World"><a href="#Your-Contribution-to-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Your Contribution to the World"></a>Your Contribution to the World</h2><p>When you feel like you’re making an impact, you will be really compelled to do more. But what about when you feel you are a burden on the world, getting educated and fear you will not be able to give back as much? Well it is in times like these when we should remind ourselves about the valuable contribution that we will make once we have the knowledge and skills to do so. Without skills we may be able to reach a hundred. But with these skills, the number is multiplied due to greater reputation and we are able to help a lot more. </p>
<h2 id="Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task"><a href="#Just-Get-Started-on-a-Small-Task" class="headerlink" title="Just Get Started on a Small Task"></a>Just Get Started on a Small Task</h2><p>When I came back, I knew that to get back to my old flow state, it wouldn’t be enough to remind myself of why I must take the first step. I also needed a clear first step to take. Getting started on the first task gives you the first rung on the ladder with which you can see the rest of the landscape clearer. Every step you take, it becomes easier to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>So, are you stuck in a peak, wondering how to proceed like me? Send me a message!</p>

    	<p>You might be thinking to yourself right now, all these concentration development tactics are great and all, but how do I actually put them into practice? As a student, this question has also been a focus of mine, so let me take a few moments to highlight my strategy (as suggested by Cal Newport) and the reason for each step. You will see lots of the strategies that Cal discusses, as well as some improvements that I have made.</p>
<h1 id="The-Student-Samurai"><a href="#The-Student-Samurai" class="headerlink" title="The Student Samurai"></a>The Student Samurai</h1><p>Soon, you too could be knocking tasks out like your favourite cartoon character. Let me show you exactly how:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to know what we need to do, and by when. Use your favourite to do list, be it digital or paper and pen, to do this.</li>
<li>We then need to condense this information into a calendar, so you can plan to do certain tasks in certain sections of the day</li>
<li>Finally, make sure trivial tasks such as taking the trash out, minor cleaning and planning meetups are clumped together and done in one part of the day. This way we can focus and get these done as fast as we can.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Reason"><a href="#Reason" class="headerlink" title="Reason"></a>Reason</h1><p>The reason that we create a huge todo list first is to give our brain the freedom to list out all its desires. Then, by prioritising this onto a calendar we are setting a clear goal for ourselves which we will strive to achieve. This is much better than, say, just checking things off as you do them. Finally, clumping minor tasks together allows Deep Work to take place, so that we can truely focus on the main tasks in the main parts of the day.  </p>
<h1 id="Pitfalls"><a href="#Pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Pitfalls"></a>Pitfalls</h1><p>Some major problems with this method are that predicting timing of each task can be a challenge. I normally address this with a technique called Kaizen, which definitely deserves its own blogpost. However, in short, Kaizen is the practice of repeatedly enforcing small positive changes based on the outcome from a previous decision, which in this case would be whether you went under or over time, and you would base future predictions on that task accordingly. There’s a lot more to Kaizen, and I really suggest reading “One Small Step Can Change Your Life” to find out more about this technique. </p>

	  <p>This is a point that is often discussed so I wanted to bring it up too:</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Catch-Up"><a href="#How-To-Catch-Up" class="headerlink" title="How To Catch Up"></a>How To Catch Up</h1><p>We’ve all been there. 1 day behind. 1 week behind. Even a whole semester behind with the exam in two days. How do you catch up. Well it does depend on how far behind you really are. There is a different level of commitment and prioritisation that is required for each specific condition. Depending on the severity of the gap, we need to adjust this to fit. </p>
<p>Lets discuss this in the next post. </p>

	  <p>Through many years of experimentation I have finally gathered enough data points to answer the question that all diligent students end up asking at some point.</p>
<h1 id="Google-Calendar-A-Blessing-or-a-curse"><a href="#Google-Calendar-A-Blessing-or-a-curse" class="headerlink" title="Google Calendar - A Blessing or a curse?"></a>Google Calendar - A Blessing or a curse?</h1><p>So hows your relationship with calendars? If you’re anything like most people, you plan out your day intricately, only to not follow the plan you carefully designed. This happens because of two main reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You were not aware of the time it would take to complete a task and hence fell behind schedule</li>
<li>You were trying to make an approximate schedule in which the time for each task was too long and no breaks were assigned.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In tomorrows series, we will continue to explore how to make better Kaizen decisions when it comes to honing your schedule so you can be more productivity during the times that matter to you the most. </p>

	  <p>Trying a Kaizen strategy in my application strategy for vacation and internship positions has got me thinking, how else can I use it to enhance my life, so that I am more energized, connected and can achieve more every day. Even just this mindset, no matter how small, can create the environment that is required to insinuate change.</p>
<h1 id="The-importance-of-holding-yourself-accountable"><a href="#The-importance-of-holding-yourself-accountable" class="headerlink" title="The importance of holding yourself accountable"></a>The importance of holding yourself accountable</h1><p>During the beginning of this semester, I listed out the activities which I would have to complete each and every day with one key request. The request was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write down exactly why you skipped this activity this week, including stuff which you could have done better in the future to make sure this doesnt happen again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By doing this, I got my brain into the habit of thinking about time as a precious entity and utilising it to the best of my abilities. </p>
<p>Next, I will take a look at what else I have done to ensure activities are completed, including setting due dates and tailoring activities to fit my other scheduled classes and work commitments. </p>

	  <p>If you recall, a few weeks ago I discussed the benefits of incremental improvement, based on the belief that fear is much harder to overcome when making a monumental change, compared to a small, purposeful manipulation. We discussed how we can use this in our own lives, with an example about work and family issues. Today, and probably from here on out, I will be writing about my own life and discuss the implications of doing Kaizen to fuel my self-improvement drive.</p>
<h1 id="One-Small-Step"><a href="#One-Small-Step" class="headerlink" title="One Small Step"></a>One Small Step</h1><p>What one small step did I take today, that can, in turn, create monumental changes in my life?</p>
<p>Today was Thursday. It has always been one of my goals to have one day where I focus on applying for work, fixing up my resume and other projects, rather than studying for uni. Of course I still have classes, but today was the day that I planned to do that. Although a lot of today was not put to the best of use, here is what I have done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied for a position at the Big 4</li>
<li>Started to add metrics and quantitative data to my resume</li>
<li>Developed the front-end for the database system </li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that this step puts me in the correct direction because a purposeful activity such as setting a day aside for this work allows me to get serious about applying for future roles. It also means I start thinking about how to get better at it each week, leading to further inspiration and motivation. </p>
<p>For now though, the small step has not left me very stressed or confused, so I am completely happy with it.</p>
<p>More about this tomorrow.  </p>

	  <p>It’s now easy to see why texting become the new norm for communication between adolescents. It can also be seen why there is a lack of strong bonding. Non-verbal communication can carry so much information that it can many times replace what is being said. It is no wonder that speakers from different countries who speak the same language can still have trouble communicating, since they come from vastly different cultures.</p>
<p>Short post for today! Stay tuned tomorrow for an insight into my activities for the past few weeks!</p>
